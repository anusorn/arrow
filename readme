Agnostic Request Routing Workflow (ARROW)

Usage: ./arrow <Listening_IP> <default_host_to_redirect_to>

Listening IP can be 0.0.0.0 or :: for any interface. Alternatively, an address of desired interface is given.
Default host should be FQDN without any protocol prefixes, e.g. cloudfront.com (no closing dot as in DNS master files).
HTTP router will use this name to issue 302 redirect, for instance:

GET /foo/bar/live.f4m
Host: hyvd.cnn.com

Request Router could not match the requester IP address against the ranges specified in range.web file, then it returns:

302 Found
Location: http://cloudfront.com/hyvd.cnn.com/foo/bar/live.f4m

DNS router will use this default host to return it as CNAME in Answer section of authoritative response to any query,
originating from requester whose IP address could not be matched against the ranges specified in range.dns file.

range.* files format:

<IP_low> <IP_high> <Streaming_point_ID>

It is possible to comment out the line with '#' to disable the range. Streaming point ID 1 corresponds to the very first
line (and no empty lines allowed) in spids file. Streaming Point ID 0 also disables the range altogether.

spids file describes the Streaming points. Each line of the file corresponds to a Streaming point with ID that
equals to the line number (starting from 1). Empty or beginning with '#' line means that the streaming point is out of
service, and all corresponding requests are diverted to the default host (provided in the command line argument).

Time-to-live of TCP connection is 10 seconds. Requester is advised to close the connection via HTTP header in 302 response.
If the connection lives more than 10 seconds for whatever reason it is reset.

Time-to-live of DNS response is specified as 1 day.

When the daemon (./arrow) starts it looks for spids, range.web, and range.dns files in its working folder. spids file
must be present. If range.web not present - web server (http request router) will not start. If range.dns not present -
dns server (dns request router) will not start. This cannot be changed by putting in either file later and hupping the
daemon. HUP signal will reload all configuration files in work though.

Syslog facilities engaged: INFO, ERROR, CRITICAL (daemon's death). Full IPv4 and IPv6 support.

NOTES

IPv4 addresses in rang.* files will be ok on IPv6-only server due to internal IPv4MAPPED handling feature.

DNS request router is pared DNS server capable of just A, AAAA, and Any requests. Therefore, it will not qualify under
IANA (https://www.iana.org/help/nameserver-requirements) for a top-level server. The following workaround solves this.

Your CDN domain is maintained at proper name servers, and let this domain be hyvd.net for instance. Then the zone file
for hyvd.net contains:

x.hyvd.net.  86400  IN  NS  glue.hyvd.net.
glue.hyvd.net. 86400  IN  A   54.72.83.1

Now, "cp.x.hyvd.net" is a content provider named "cp", and 54.72.83.1 is the present DNS request router.
